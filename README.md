## Introduction

The package is a modified version of the build output of `redlock`. It is not a direct copy of the source code.

When the `tsconfig.json` is configured with certain properties, `typescript` will read the `exports` field from the `package.json`.

However, `redlock@5.0.0-beta.2` did not set `"exports['.'].types": "./dist/index.d.ts"` in its `package.json`, which prevented TypeScript from properly resolving the type files.

Also, `redlock@5.0.0-beta.2` uses `"type": "module"` in its `package.json`, which defaults to the ESM (ES Module) format. Therefore, `@hz-9/redlock-dist` was created.

## Different with `redlock`
